## What is Aeons End
Aeons End is a cooperative deck-building game made by Action Phase Board Games for 2-4 players. After a group of citizens were forced to take refuge in an underground city called Gravehold they learned to harness the power that was there. Still being attacked by the Nameless and their powerful spells the city relies on their last defense, the Breach Mages. Led by Brama these mages use the power of the crystals to fight back and defend their city. 

Players start the game by selecting the mages they want to play fromt the mage pool and gathering their respective starting cards. The players then choose the supply cards consisting of 3 Gems, 2 Relics, and 4 Spells to be the community pool available for purchase. Finally to finish set up, the players will choose which monster they want to fight and get the cards needed for that boss.
