## What is Aeons End
Aeons End is a cooperative deck-building game made by Action Phase Board Games for 2-4 players. After a group of citizens were forced to take refuge in an underground city called Gravehold they learned to harness the power that was there. Still being attacked by the Nameless and their powerful spells the city relies on their last defense, the Breach Mages. Led by Brama these mages use the power of the crystals to fight back and defend their city. 

Players start the game by selecting the mages they want to play from the mage pool and gathering their respective starting cards. The players then choose the supply cards consisting of 3 Gems, 2 Relics, and 4 Spells to be the community pool available for purchase. Finally to finish set up, the players will choose which monster they want to fight and get the cards needed for that boss. 

Players shuffle the turn order deck and flip over a card and perform their turn when their card flips. In the deck they're will be 1 card for every player and 2 for the monster. On the players turn they have a variety of actions inlcuding buying cards, prepping spells, casting spells, or using their ability. On the monster's turn the players flip over a card from the nemesis deck and follow the instructions given on the card. Once the turn order cards are all use, shuffle the deck and repeat the steps above. For the most part, players win when they do enough damage to the monster to reduce its health to 0 or make the nemesis deck run out of acrs, and lose when the monster achieves its win condition or all players health is reduced to 0.
