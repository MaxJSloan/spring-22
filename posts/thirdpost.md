## What is Blood Rage
Blood Rage is a player versus player card-drafting game made by Cool Mini or Not for 2 to 4 people. Take control of a clan of vikings, pillage towns, and serve the Gods to gain the most glory! Afterall, what is a vikings life without glory?

Players start by selecting one of four viking clans to lead and take their respective miniatures with it (1 leader, 8 warriors, 1 ship). The clans do not differ in anything besides aesthetic. Mechanically they play the same. Take all the Pillage tokens and place the one with the green border on the Yggdrasil province at the center of the board, with the reward side facing up. Shuffle the other 8 Pillage tokens and place them randomly on the other 8 provinces surrounding Yggdrasil, face up. The Pillage tokens show the reward you get for pillaging that province. Players then all get dealt 8 cards. Players proceed to take one card and pass the remainging cards in hand to the left. Players do this until all players have 6 cards. Discard the remaining cards. Now the action phase starts, where the majority of the game takes place. 

All players begin the Action phase with the amount of Rage indicated by the Rage stat on their clan sheet. If this is the first Age, you've already taken care of this by placing your Clan token at 6 Rage during setup. In subsequent Ages, if you have improved your clan's Rage stat, you will begin the Action phase with more Rage.
On your turn, you must choose a single action to perform. If that action carries a cost in Rage (it usually does), you must pay that cost and then take your action. Move the token on your clan's Rage Track to indicate how much Rage you've spent. If you do not have enough Rage to fully pay for a particular action, you cannot take that action. Once you run out of rage you can not take any more actions, even if it cost 0 rage. Once all players have depleted their rage or all villages have been pillages the age ends. Players discard down to one card, settle quests, destroy a province with Ragnarok, and get all of their characters back from Vahalla (graveyard). As you advance into the next age draft new cards the same way you began to play and proceed the same way. 

At the end of 3 ages whomever has the most glory is the winner. 

## Review 
I adore this game. It limits luck and forces you to adapt strategies quickly. The cards synergize well together if you can make them and allows for creative strategy. The norse mythology theme works well too and this is brought to life in the miniatures. The miniatures may be the best in board games and if you really want to take the beatiful design to the next level you can even paint them. Everything about this game excites me and keeps me playing.
